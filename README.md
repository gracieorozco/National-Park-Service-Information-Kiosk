# National Park Service Information Kiosk
This web applicationâ€™s purpose is to help users find information involving the national parks in the United States by using the National Park Service API. There are thirteen different categories a user can choose to search up information in. There are ten unique categories in total while the other three are a combination of the ten categories. The website consists of search bars to send user input to the NPS API while retrieving the results using JavaScript to decode the JSON objects. The results are then displayed onto the HTML page, where I used the Bootstrap framework to make the data visually easier to read. The website is responsive to any device and adjusts its layout accordingly, allowing mobile devices to access this website as well.
